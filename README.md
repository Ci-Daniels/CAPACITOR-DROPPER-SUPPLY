# CAPACITOR-DROPPER-SUPPLY
The following is a repository about a transformerless power supply.

## INTRODUCTION
As the name defines, a transformerless power supply circuit provides a low DC from the mains high voltage AC, without using any form of transformer or inductor.
It works by using a high voltage capacitor to drop the mains AC current to the required lower level which may be suitable for the connected electronic circuit or load.

## BILL OF MATERIALS
- Electrolytic capacitor
- Four rectifier diodes
- Zener diode
- Two resistors rated 1 watt
- A filter capacitor

### ADVANTAGES
  -Low cost
  -small in size
  -Economical; low cost as compared to transformers.

### DISAVDANTAGES
The drawback of the Capacitor power supply includes;

-No galvanic isolation from Mains. So if the power supply section fails, it can harm the gadget.
-Low current output. With a Capacitor power supply. 
  -The maximum output current available will be 100 mA or less. So it is not ideal to run heavy current inductive loads.
-Output voltage and current will not be stable if the AC input varies.
